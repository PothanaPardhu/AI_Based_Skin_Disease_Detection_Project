# 🌿 AI-Based Skin Disease Detector
An AI-Based skin disease detector is an CNN Machine learning app that analyzes uploaded skin images to detect skin disease conditions like acne, eczema, dryness, hyperpigmentation, and healthy skin, while providing personalized skincare tips..

This project was an intelligent, real-time skin health monitoring system that detects common skin conditions using **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** and an elegant **Streamlit** UI. Empower users with fast, accessible, and accurate skin disease predictions—right from their browser!

## 🚀 Features

✅ **Deep Learning Powered** – Uses a trained CNN model built with **TensorFlow** for high-accuracy classification  
✅ **Real-Time Detection** – Upload your skin image and get instant predictions  
✅ **Interactive UI** – Built with **Streamlit** for a sleek, responsive interface  
✅ **Lottie Animations** – Visually enhanced with animations to improve user experience  
✅ **Lightweight & Fast** – Optimized for performance and easy deployment

## 🔥 How It Works

1. **User Uploads Skin Image**  
2. **Model Preprocesses the Image**  
3. **CNN Predicts Skin Condition**  
4. **Result Displayed with Recommendations**
